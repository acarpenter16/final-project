I. 	My project is a simple instrument in which the player must navigate the colored path to play a song. The ultimate goal entails playing the song and reaching the end of the path, which triggers a music note image. In order to reach said goal the player must use the directional buttons and move diagonally in an efficient manner and be careful not to move onto dead cells (seeing as though they’d have to start at the beginning). 

II. 	I wanted to be sure to incorporate music in some way, and by completing my project after learning more about tones and button use I was able to accomplish that. I got stuck multiple times, but the two that stick out the most would be tones themselves and button use. The scale in which the tones are arranged didn’t always line up with the scale used by the songs I had been trying to use, but I was able to work through that by switching songs. As for button use, I needed it because the tone would play, but if there were two of the same tone next to each other it would just play a continuous note - I tried to solve that with button pressing but it didn’t work. In order to fix that I ended up putting white dots in between the repeating notes (since it doesn’t play a tone). An instance in which I was aided by a class mate was when I was having trouble figuring out why the music wouldn’t sound right despite having the correct notes and Sree explained that the scale was being utilized in a different fashion. On the other hand, I was able to help Katelyn by checking her code to make sure that little errors weren’t hindering her game’s performance. If I could improve my project I’d probably have a better song. 

III. I tested Kelly and Natalie’s projects. In both instances I thought their projects were creative and cool. The feedback I gave them was positive, and I just mentioned the lagginess to Natalie and suggested that it might change depending on the Meggy being used. Later, Kelly, Natalie, and Hipatia tested my instrument but didn’t seem to have much criticism other than it was a bit difficult to figure out which song it was at first (Twinkle Twinkle), so I sped up the dot speed so it might work better with the tempo of the song. 

IV. I like that we started with that style of coding while using the Meggy because it allowed for creativity and freedom in what we wanted to make. I think the most challenging part about programming with Meggy was the fact that I missed some class time/lessons, so when it came down to it I didn’t completely understand the concepts at the time, like arrays for example. The most useful resource was probably Mrs. Kiang and the PDF guide to programming for the Meggy. My advice to someone just learning how to code with Arduino would be to be patient and pay attention to the concepts you’re being taught because it’ll come in handy. As a whole, I think I’m most proud of the fact that I always come up with the somewhat creative ideas for many of my projects, seeing as though they’re often different from others.
